            <p>For 60 years we have worked to preserve the traditional music of Scotland, and to further the Scottish
                arts in Kansas City and abroad. The band was founded in 1962 and incorporates the talents of over forty
                musicians, ranging in age from teens to over seventy. We are primarily a community-oriented band
                committed to furthering the development of piping and drumming in Kansas City and the Midwest.

            <p>We currently field a Grade V competition band. In addition to our many successes over the years in band
                events, including second place in piping at the World Pipe Band Championships (Grade 3-A 2001), many of
                our members have competed and taken prizes in some of the most prestigious solo piping and drumming
                contests in North America, with over eight of our members competing in the professional grade, and with
                several more competing at the grade one and two levels. But foremost, we pride ourselves in being a
                family-oriented organization.
