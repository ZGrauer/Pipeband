  <meta name="description" content="For 60 years Kansas City St. Andrew Pipes & Drums have worked to preserve the traditional music of Scotland. We are primarily a community-oriented band committed to furthering the development of piping and drumming in Kansas City. As Kansas City's premier pipe band, we are proud to provide award-winning individual bagpipers, small ensembles, or even a full band for your next event in a number of price ranges as your taste and resources fancy. We also have affiliations with Scottish Highland dancers, Irish step dancers, and Celtic folk bands should you want to create a one-of-a-kind treat for your guests.">
